## Process

We use a fork-and-PR process, also known as a triangular workflow. This process
is fairly common in open-source projects. Here's the basic workflow:

1. Fork the repo to create your own. This repo is called the origin repo.
2. Work your changes on a branch in your repo.
3. Submit your changes as a PR against the upstream repo.
4. Maintainers review your changes. If they ask for changes, you work on your
    origin repo's branch. Otherwise, the branch is merged to upstream's main
    trunk.

When you work in a triangular workflow, you have the upstream repo, the origin
repo, and then your local clone of the origin repo. You fetch from upstream to
local, push from local to origin, and then do a PR from origin to
upstream&mdash;a triangle.

If this workflow is too much to understand to start, that's ok! You can use
GitHub's UI to make a change, which is autoset to do most of this process for
you. We just want you to be aware of how the entire process works before
proposing a change.
